### Description:
<p>'Catch The Deadline' will be a 2D platformer arcade-style game developed in Java, in which the protagonist of the game is a student, who needs to satisfy academic expectations by overcoming a set number of obstacles. The student avoids the obstructions on his way to catching the deadline by running and jumping and eliminates distractions and enemies(homeworks & exams) by using his weapons such as 'The Mighty Pen'. 
</p>
<p>
The game will consist of multiple levels and if time permits, we will be adding features, such as a game chat and a multiplayer game.
